    <h4>
        <p> On 5 August 2021, Manchester City announced that they had signed Grealish on a six-year contract that would
            run until
            2027. It was reported by numerous outlets that the transfer fee paid to Aston Villa was for the amount
            of £100
            million, which at the time constituted the most expensive transfer of an English player ever, as well as the
            highest fee
            ever paid by a British club. Grealish was given the number 10 shirt by the team which had previously
            been worn
            by striker Sergio Agüero, who departed from City the month prior after ten seasons with the team.
            Grealish made his
            debut for City in a 1–0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur on the first matchday of the 2021–22 Premier
            League. On 21
            August, Grealish scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 win over Norwich City. He scored on his
            Champions
            League debut on 15 September, putting City 4–2 up in an eventual 6–3 home victory over RB Leipzig in the
            opening group
            stage match. He also assisted Nathan Aké's goal for City's opener. In December 2021, Grealish and
            teammate Phil
            Foden were dropped for a game against Newcastle after a nightclub visit. Of his time at Manchester City
            that season,
            Grealish admitted that adapting to the club’s style of play had been "much more difficult" than he
            imagined, despite
            the fact that his manager Pep Guardiola believed that he was successfully fulfilling his role. Grealish
            was later
            defended from his critics by his teammate Kevin De Bruyne, who voiced his belief that Grealish was an easy
            target for
            criticism because of the media spotlight on English players. Moreover, İlkay Gündoğan claimed that
            Grealish was “so
            misunderstood by some of the media”.

        <center <p> On 17 September 2022, Grealish scored his first goal of the season after just 55 seconds of an away
            match
            against Wolverhampton Wanderers. On 28 December 2022, Grealish assisted twice for Erling Haaland as
            Manchester City beat Leeds United away from home with a score of 1-3. On 14 January 2023, Grealish
            scored in a 2-1 away defeat against Manchester United. On 15 February 2023, Grealish scored in a 1-3
            away victory against league leaders Arsenal to overtake them in the Premier League title race. Grealish
            was highly commended for a performance against Liverpool on 1 April 2023 in which Manchester City won 4-1
            after going one goal behind. In this game, Grealish scored and also provided an assist for Julián
            Álvarez.On 22 February, Grealish assisted Riyad Mahrez for City's goal against RB Leipzig in the
            2022–23 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 and was later lauded as "unplayable" by both Rio Ferdinand and
            Owen Hargreaves.On 8 April 2023, Grealish scored and assisted in a 1-4 away victory against
            Southampton. Proceeding a 1-1 draw against Real Madrid in the first leg of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions
            League semi-finals on 9 May, Grealish recorded a message for an ailing Manchester City supporter, Rob
            Harmston, to send his “love and support". After that same game, it was calculated at that time that
            Grealish had created 35 chances in that season's Champions League alone: this was the most on record by an
            English player in a single season. On 17 May, Grealish was a standout performer as Manchester City beat
            Real Madrid 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium in the second leg of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League semi-finals,
            being described by Jamie Jackson of The Guardian as "scintillating". On 20 May, Grealish won the Premier
            League after Arsenal lost 1-0 in a defeat to Nottingham Forest. Manchester City lifted the Premier
            League trophy the following day. On 3 June, Grealish won the FA Cup final against Manchester United.
            Grealish later spoke of how the achievement was the "stuff you dream of when you’re a little kid". On 10
            June, Grealish won the 2023 UEFA Champions League final against Inter Milan with a score of 1-0. In
            an interview after the game, Grealish said the achievement was "what you work your whole life for" and
            called his manager Pep Guardiola a “genius”. Grealish was seen, after a day and night of partying,
            stumbling off of a plane, apparently drunk and lacking sleep.[C] He was later seen celebrating, still in
            full kit, just hours before Manchester City’s treble parade. During this treble parade, Grealish was
            also positively identified by the media as enjoying himself greatly.[D]

        <br>
        Following the 2022–23 season, in which he won a continental treble, it was suggested that Grealish could
        become a potential candidate for the Ballon d'Or. Grealish was praised by critics for his large
        contribution to Manchester City’s success. It was suggested by analysts and commentators as a
        result of Grealish’s rich vein of form that he had successfully settled into the club and was living up to
        his large price tag.[E] Neil Johnston of BBC Sport commented that Grealish had become “almost undroppable
        for the big games”. Grealish himself commented that he now felt “like one of the main players [of
        Manchester City]” and that he was at a stage whereby he was “the fittest… [he had ever] been”.
