  <h5 style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: lighter;"> Manchester City Football Club is an English professional football
    club based in Manchester that competes in the
    Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick
    Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894.The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won
    their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late
    1960s
    and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of
    Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison.After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline,
    culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998.

  Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second
  Division
  play-off final against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this
  proved
  to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan
  replaced
  Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the
  2001–02
  First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single
  season
  in the process.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club
  the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the
  Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club
  broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.

    Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player
    quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby
    rivals
    Manchester United in the semi-finals, the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since
    1975.
    The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy
    since
    winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time
    since 1968 with a 1–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the penultimate Premier League match.

  Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, with the club beginning the campaign in commanding
  form, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a 6–1 humbling of Manchester United at Old
  Trafford. Although the strong form waned halfway through the season, and City at one point fell eight points behind
  United with only six games left to play, a slump by United allowed the blue side of Manchester to draw back level
  with
  two games to go, setting up a thrilling finale to the season with both teams going into the last day equal on points
  (City led by eight goals on goal difference). Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers,
  a
  team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time, leading some of United's players to
  finish their game, a 1–0 win at Sunderland, celebrating in the belief that they had won the league. However, two
  goals
  in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – resulted in an almost-literal last-minute
  3–2 title victory, City's first in 44 years, with which they became only the fifth team to win the Premier League
  since its creation in 1992. In its aftermath, the event was described by media sources from the UK and around the
  world as the greatest moment in Premier League history.

  In Pellegrini's first season, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of
  the season. However, the team's league form was less impressive in the next couple of years: although they finished
  as
  runners-up in 2014–15, the 2015–16 campaign saw City end up fourth on goal difference, their lowest position since
  2010. On the other hand, Pellegrini delivered another League Cup win and, more importantly, he guided City to the
  Champions League semi-finals, which they narrowly lost to future champions Real Madrid. This was the club's
  highest-ever finish in the Champions League, but Pellegrini's reign was nonetheless ended in anticipation of City's
  dream manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new
  manager
  on 1 February 2016, months before Pellegrini finished his term, and has remained in charge to this day. In the
  Guardiola era, City won the 2017–18 Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous
  other club and English league records along the way. They also won the League Cup that season, and Sergio Agüero
  became the club's all-time leading goalscorer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The following season, Guardiola guided the club to retain their Premier League and League Cup titles, the first time
  in history that City had completed any successful title defence. The team then went on to win the FA Cup final and
  complete an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles

  City produced another campaign to remember in 2021–22, retaining their league title, following another close title
  race with Liverpool and making it four titles in five seasons. In another case of "typical City", needing four
  points
  from their last two fixtures, the Blues had fallen behind by two goals in both games, only to recover to a 2–2 draw
  at
  West Ham, and to a 3–2 home win against Aston Villa in the season finale. These last three goals were all scored in
  a
  five-minute blitz between the 76th and 81st minutes, in moments that would sit alongside the famous victories in the
  1999 play-off final against Gillingham and the 2011–12 Premier League finale against QPR.
