        <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; font-weight: lighter;">
            From the club's inception in 1880,
            Manchester City – first known as St Mark's (West Gorton), then as West Gorton A.F.C. and by mid-1884 as just
            Gorton A.F.C. – had struggled to find a stable location to base themselves. Originally simply playing on a
            dangerously bumpy patch of grass near to the church of their origin, the club quickly signed an agreement to
            ground-share with the Kirkmanshulme Cricket Club before being turfed out only a year later. Three further
            pitches were then created on wasteland over the following four seasons, but all proved inadequate for one
            reason or another. When their fifth pitch arrangement collapsed in 1887, with the landlord of the Bulls Head
            Hotel demanding a rent increase for the use of a nearby field, the club were forced to seek an alternative
            venue. Then-captain Kenneth McKenzie discovered an area of waste ground on Hyde Road in Ardwick and near to
            his place of work, and informed the club committee. Lawrence Furniss, the club secretary, ascertained that
            the ground was owned by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Company. Following an initial
            letter of enquiry by Gorton player Walter Chew to railway company estate agent Edwin Barker, Furniss and
            Chew negotiated a seven-month lease at a cost of £10, and the club changed its name to " Ardwick A.F.C." to
            reflect the new location. A few weeks later, using materials provided by the nearby Galloway engineering
            works, a rudimentary football ground was ready for use. The ground had no changing rooms, and teams changed
            in a nearby public house, the Hyde Road Hotel, where the football club held business meetings. The ground's
            first seating area was built in 1888, with 1,000 seats,paid for by Chesters Brewery in return for the right
            to be the sole provider of alcohol inside the ground. Ardwick were admitted to the Football League in 1892.
            The first league match held at Hyde Road was a 7–0 Ardwick win against Bootle on 3 September 1892. Two years
            later the club reformed as "Manchester City F.C." <br>

    <br>
    The increasing popularity of the football club resulted in improvements being made to the ground on several
    occasions.
    Improvements costing £600 were made in 1890, and changing rooms were provided in 1896. A new stand was purchased
    for
    £1,500 in 1898, and £2,000 worth of improvements were made in 1904, resulting in a capacity of 40,000 with
    stands on
    three sides.This development resulted in Hyde Road being chosen to host two prestigious matches—an inter-league
    match between the English League and the Irish League, and an FA Cup semi-final between Newcastle United and The
    Wednesday. In 1910 multi-span roofing was built on the three previously uncovered sides of the ground, resulting
    in
    covered accommodation for 35,000 spectators.
    <p>
        <br>
    <p> During the suspension of competitive football in the First World War, Hyde Road's redevelopment was put on
        hold
        and the venue was used to stable 300 horses. Later in the wartime period the club became the sole
        leaseholder of
        the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was £500.
        In
        1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; King
        George
        V attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and Liverpool. In November a fire caused by a
        cigarette end destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions
        raised
        the possibility of sharing Old Trafford with neighbors Manchester United, but United's proposed rent was
        prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.

    <br>
    <p> Plans for the club to move to a new ground—Maine Road—in Moss Side were announced in 1922. The final
        Manchester
        City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a
        public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 1923–24
        season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the
        Main
        Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde
        Road
        roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road.
        The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road
        depot
        and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and
        materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the
        city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett
        Street
        side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of
        the
        old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area.
        As
        of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic Freight Terminal, a container storage and warehousing facility.

    <p> Plans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922, following a decision by Manchester City F.C. to
        leave their Hyde Road ground, which did not have room for expansion and its main stand had been severely
        damaged
        by fire in 1920. A 16.25 acre former brickworks on Maine Road was purchased for £5,500. Maine Road was
        originally known as Dog
        Kennel Lane but renamed Maine Road (after the Maine law) during the 1870s at the insistence of the
        Temperance
        movement which owned land on Dog Kennel Lane and the local authority accepted its request.

        During construction, the stadium was reputedly cursed by a Gypsy when officials evicted a Gypsy camp from
        the
        area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. However, the Gypsy curse is likely to be an
        urban myth, as such stories are endemic to a number of football league grounds. Construction took 300 days,
        the
        total cost £100,000. The initial layout of the ground consisted of one covered stand with a seating capacity
        of 10,000, and uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> The first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923 when 58,159 fans watched the home side beat
        Sheffield
        United 2–1. The first changes to the ground took place in 1931, when the corner between the Main Stand and
        the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof. This renovation was the
        first of many, as Maine Road's layout and capacity was varied throughout its lifespan.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1934, the highest attendance for an English football club playing at their own stadium was recorded at
        Maine
        Road, when Manchester City played Stoke City in front of 84,569 fans, in the sixth round of the FA Cup on 3
        March 1934. (A larger crowd of 121,919 attended the Crystal Palace ground when it hosted the 1913 FA Cup
        Final between Aston Villa and Sunderland.) Queues formed four hours before the match, and one journalist
        stated
        that Maine Road was packed two hours before kick-off. A decision was taken to close the turnstiles with an
        attendance at approximately 85,000, 3000 short of what was thought to be the maximum capacity. Supporters
        witnessed a visiting Stoke team which included Stanley Matthews and City's team boasted players Frank Swift,
        Fred Tilson, Sam Cowan and Matt Busby.The match was won 1–0 by Manchester City. This is the record home
        attendance for a domestic match and the record home attendance at a club ground, as the 1913 FA Cup final is
        not
        considered a home match for either team.

        <br>
        The stadium was shared by Manchester United after the Second World War as Manchester United's Old Trafford
        ground had been damaged during the Manchester Blitz. United paid City £5,000 per season, plus a share of
        gate
        receipts. The highest attendance for a league game at Maine Road occurred during this period, when 83,260
        people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on 17 January 1948. This figure is a national record for a
        league
        game. Maine Road was also used by Manchester United to host three of their four home games in the 1956–57
        European Cup, until Old Trafford was equipped with floodlights as required by UEFA.
        Floodlights for the stadium were installed in 1953 and further development took place in 1957. This was
        prompted
        by the hosting of two FA Cup semi-finals in successive years, the side facing the Main Stand (which until
        that time was generally known as the Popular Side) was redeveloped and named The Kippax after a nearby
        street. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Kippax became the part of the ground where the club's
        most vociferous fans congregated. In 1963, benches were installed at the Platt Lane end, meaning that Maine
        Road had more seats than any other English club ground of the time.
        <br>
        There were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to an all-seated 45,000, but these
        were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.
        <br>
        <br>
        The final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003 with a Premiership
        match
        against Southampton. Tickets were sold upwards of £250 and a crowd of 34,957, about 100 off maximum capacity
        filled Maine Road for the final day. City lost the match 1–0 with Michael Svensson scoring the stadium's
        last goal. The final match was followed by performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves.

        City's final goal at the stadium was scored on 21 April 2003 by Marc-Vivien Foé during a 3–0 victory over
        Sunderland. Forty-five days later, the player died on 26 June from an undetected heart condition while
        representing the Cameroon national football team during the 2003 Confederations Cup.

    <h4 style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px; font-weight: lighter;">
        <p> Plans to build a new stadium in Manchester were formulated before 1989 as part of the city's bid to host the
            1996 Summer Olympics. Manchester City Council submitted a bid that included a design for an 80,000-capacity
            stadium on a greenfield site west of Manchester city centre. The bid failed and Atlanta hosted the Games.
            Four
            years later the city council bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, but this time focusing on a brownfield
            site
            1.6 kilometres (0.99 mi) east of the city centre on derelict land that was the site of Bradford Colliery,
            known colloquially as Eastlands. The council's shift in focus was driven by emerging government legislation
            on
            urban renewal, promising vital support funding for such projects; the government became involved in funding
            the
            purchase and clearance of the Eastlands site in 1992.
            <br>
            <br>
            For the February 1993 bid the city council submitted another 80,000-capacity stadium design produced by
            design
            consultants Arup, the firm that helped select the Eastlands site. On 23 September 1993, the games were
            awarded
            to Sydney, but the following year Manchester submitted the same scheme design to the Millennium Commission
            as a
            "Millennium Stadium", only to have this proposal rejected. Undeterred, Manchester City Council subsequently
            bid
            to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, once again proposing the same site along with downsized stadium plans
            derived from the 2000 Olympics bid, and this time were successful. In 1996, this same planned stadium
            competed
            with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the new national stadium, but the money was used to redevelop
            Wembley.

            <br>
            Sport England wished to avoid creating a white elephant, so they insisted that the City Council agree to
            undertake and fund extensive work to convert CoMS from a track and field arena to a football stadium,
            thereby
            ensuring its long-term financial viability. Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester
            City F.C. would provide the extra £50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65,000 seater athletics
            and
            footballing venue with movable seating. However, Manchester City Council did not have the money to
            facilitate
            movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup believed history
            demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited
            examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving
            to
            new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.

            The first public football match at the stadium was a friendly between Manchester City and Barcelona on 10
            August
            2003. Manchester City won the game 2–1, with Nicolas Anelka scoring the first ever goal in the stadium.

            The first competitive match followed four days later, a UEFA Cup match between Manchester City and Welsh
            Premier
            League side Total Network Solutions, which City won 5–0 with Trevor Sinclair scoring the first competitive
            goal
            in the stadium. Having started the Premier League season with an away match, Manchester City's first home
            league fixture in the new stadium was on 23 August, a game drawn 1–1 with Portsmouth, with Pompey's Yakubu
            scoring the first league goal in the stadium, and David Sommeil being the first City player to score here in
            the
            league.

            2011–12 saw the Etihad Stadium play host to the setting of a number of
            new club and Premier League footballing records, such as the club becoming the first ever team to win eleven
            of its opening twelve games in a Premier League season, and going on to remain unbeaten at the Etihad
            Stadium in all nineteen of the Premier League games played there. The club's record of 55 home points out of
            a possible 57 at the stadium is a joint best Premier League record, and the club's record of twenty
            consecutive home wins at the stadium (going back to the end of the previous season) also set a new Premier
            League record in March 2012. Action from the 2008 UEFA Cup final The record football attendance at the
            stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup final game
            between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008.As is customary for such games, the then 47,715
            maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However,
            neither limit would have been able to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club,
            estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game,
            despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets
            to stay home. This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of travelling fans and those holding
            tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably
            associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the
            stadium were perfectly well-behaved.
